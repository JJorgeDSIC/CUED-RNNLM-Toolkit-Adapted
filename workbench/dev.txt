impoverished imagination a myopic view of the world and that 's the way i read it at first the more i thought about it however the more i came to the view that this
fish knows something because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible you don 't have freedom you have paralysis
if you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible you decrease satisfaction
you increase paralysis and you decrease satisfaction everybody needs a fishbowl this one is almost certainly too limited
perhaps even for the fish certainly for us but the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery and i suspect disaster thank you very much
last year i showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower forty eight states has shrunk by forty percent
but this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn 't show the thickness of the ice the arctic ice cap is in a sense the beating heart of the global climate system it expands in winter and contracts in summer the next slide i show you will be
a rapid fast forward of what 's happened over the last twenty five years the permanent ice is marked in red and as you see it expands to the dark blue that 's the annual ice in winter and it contracts in summer
and the so called permanent ice five years old or older you can see is almost like blood spilling out of the body here
in twenty five years it 's gone from this to this this is a problem because the warming
heats up the frozen ground around the arctic ocean where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which when it thaws is turned into methane by microbes compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere that amount could double if we cross this tipping point
already in some shallow lakes in alaska methane is actively bubbling up out of the water professor katey walter from the university of alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter
she 's okay the question is whether we will be and one reason is this enormous heat sink heats up greenland from the north
this is an annual melting river but the volumes are much larger than ever this is the kangerlussuaq river in southwest
greenland if you want to know how sea level rises from land base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea these flows are increasing very rapidly
at the other end of the planet antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance and west antarctica
cropped up on top some under sea islands is particularly rapid in its melting that 's equal to twenty feet of sea level as is greenland
in the himalayas the third largest mass of ice at the top you see new lakes which a few years ago were glaciers forty percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow in the andes this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city
the flows have increased but when they go away so does much of the drinking water in california there has been a forty percent decline in the sierra snowpack this is hitting the reservoirs and the predictions as you 've read are serious this drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires
and the disasters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate four times as many in the last thirty years as in the previous seventy five this is a completely unsustainable pattern if you look at in the context of history you can see
what this is doing
in the last five years we 've added seventy million tons of co two every twenty four hours twenty five million tons every day to the oceans
look carefully at the area of the eastern pacific from the americas extending westward and on either side of the indian subcontinent where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans
the biggest single cause of global warming along with deforestation which is twenty percent of it is the burning of fossil fuels oil is a problem
and coal is the most serious problem the united states is one of the two largest emitters along with china and the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants but we 're beginning to see a sea change here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed
however there is a political battle in our country and the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal which is an oxymoron that image reminded me of something
around christmas in my home in tennessee a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled you probably saw it on the news this all over the country is the second largest waste stream in america this happened around christmas one of the coal industry 's ads around christmas was this one
this is the source of much of the coal in west virginia the largest mountaintop miner is the head of massey coal
let me be clear about it al gore nancy pelosi harry reid they don 't know what they 're talking about
so the alliance for climate protection has launched two campaigns this is one of them part of one of them
coalergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business that 's why we 've made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal
the fact is coal isn 't dirty we think it 's clean
smells good too
so don 't worry about climate change leave that up to us
clean coal you 've heard a lot about it so let 's take a tour of this state of the art clean coal facility
amazing the machinery is kind of loud but that 's the sound of clean coal technology
and while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything
take a good long look this is today 's clean coal technology
finally the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge
america is in crisis the economy national security the climate crisis
the thread that links them all our addiction to carbon based fuels like dirty coal and foreign oil
but now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess repower america
with one hundred percent clean electricity within ten years a plan to put america back to work make us more secure and help stop global warming
finally a solution that 's big enough to solve our problems repower america find out more
this is the last one
it 's about repowering america one of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet
future 's over here wind sun a new energy grid
new investments to create high paying jobs
repower america it 's time to get real
there is an old african proverb that says if you want to go quickly go alone if you want to go far go together we need to go far quickly
thank you very much
i want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid playing with blocks as you figured out how to reach out and grasp pick them up and move them around you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships
spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us so
as a computer scientist inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects along with my adviser pattie and my collaborator jeevan kalanithi i started to wonder
what if when we used a computer instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip moving around a flat desktop what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically arranging it the way we wanted
this question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer by building siftables
in a nutshell a siftable is an interactive computer the size of a cookie they 're able to be moved around by hand they can sense each other they can sense their motion and they have a screen and a wireless radio
most importantly they 're physical so like the blocks you can move them just by reaching out and grasping and siftables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipulating digital information
and as these tools become more physical more aware of their motion aware of each other and aware of the nuance of how we move them we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles so i 'm going to start with some simple examples this siftable is configured to show video and if i tilt it in one direction it 'll roll the video this way if i tilt it the other way
it rolls it backwards and these interactive portraits are aware of each other so if i put them next to each other they get interested
if they get surrounded they notice that too they might get a little flustered and they can also sense their motion and tilt
so one of the interesting implications on interaction we started to realize was that we could use everyday gestures on data
like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid so in this case we 've got three siftables configured to be paint buckets and i can use them to pour color into that central one where they get mixed if we overshoot we can pour a little bit back
there are also some neat possibilities for education like language math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly and view the results immediately so here i 'm
this is a fibonacci sequence that i 'm making with a simple equation program here we have a word game that 's kind of like a mash up between scrabble and boggle basically in every round you get a randomly assigned letter on each siftable
and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary then after about thirty seconds it reshuffles and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try
thank you
so these are some kids that came on a field trip to the media lab and i managed to get them to try it out and shoot a video
they really loved it and one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people many instructions all you have to say is make words and they know exactly what to do
so here 's another few people trying it out
that 's our youngest beta tester down there on the right
turns out all he wanted to do was to stack the siftables up so to him they were just blocks
now this is an interactive cartoon application and we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners and this is felix actually
and he can bring new characters into the scene just by lifting the siftables off the table that have that character shown on them here he 's bringing the sun out
the sun is rising
now he 's brought a tractor into the scene
the orange tractor
good job yeah
so by shaking the siftables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact
inventing his own narrative
hello
it 's an open ended story and he gets to decide how it unfolds
fly away cat
so the last example i have time to show you today is a music sequencing and live performance tool that we 've built recently in which siftables act as sounds like lead bass and drums
each of these has four different variations you get to choose which one you want to use and you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want
and you inject it by just bumping up the sound siftable against a sequence siftable there are effects that you can control live like reverb and filter you attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it
and then overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence so let 's have a look
we 'll start by putting a lead
into two sequence siftables arrange them into a series
extend it add a little more lead now i put a bassline in
now i 'll put some percussion in
and now i 'll attach the filter to the drums so i can control the effect live
i can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo to one one way or the other
and now i 'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression
i can rearrange the sequence while it plays i don 't have to plan it out in advance but i can improvise changing it making it longer or shorter as i go
and now finally i can fade the whole sequence out using the volume siftable tilted to the left
thank you so
as you can see my passion is for making new human computer interfaces that are a better match to the way our brains and bodies work and today i had time to show you
one point in this new design space and a few of the possibilities that we 're working to bring out of the laboratory
so the thought i want to leave you with is that we 're on the cusp of this new generation of tools for interacting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms thank you very much i look forward to talking with all of you
